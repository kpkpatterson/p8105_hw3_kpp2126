# Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user
and order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour.
There are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some
numeric codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles and the most items ordered are from fresh
vegetables aisle (n=150,609), fresh fruits aisle (n=150,473), followed
by packaged vegetables and fruits aisle (n=78,493).

Let’s make a plot

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Let’s make a table on Apples vs. Ice Cream.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

# Problem 2

Load, tidy, wrangle data.

``` r
accel_df = read_csv("./accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_counts") %>%
  mutate(week_type=case_when(day %in% c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday") ~ "Weekday",
                           day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday") ~ "Weekend")
         )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Tidied dataset

``` r
accel_df%>%tibble()
```

    ## # A tibble: 50,400 x 6
    ##     week day_id day    minute activity_counts week_type
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>            <dbl> <chr>    
    ##  1     1      1 Friday 1                 88.4 Weekday  
    ##  2     1      1 Friday 2                 82.2 Weekday  
    ##  3     1      1 Friday 3                 64.4 Weekday  
    ##  4     1      1 Friday 4                 70.0 Weekday  
    ##  5     1      1 Friday 5                 75.0 Weekday  
    ##  6     1      1 Friday 6                 66.3 Weekday  
    ##  7     1      1 Friday 7                 53.8 Weekday  
    ##  8     1      1 Friday 8                 47.8 Weekday  
    ##  9     1      1 Friday 9                 55.5 Weekday  
    ## 10     1      1 Friday 10                43.0 Weekday  
    ## # … with 50,390 more rows

This new dataset contains 50400 rows and 6 columns. There are 50,400
observations of activity counts that correspond to the minute they were
recorded. There are 6 variables that include 5 weeks of accelerometer
observations, a `day_id` variable that corresponds to each day of the
study (n = 35 days), and a `week_type` variable that indicates whether
an observation was on a weekday or on the weekend.

Aggregate dataset across minutes to create a total activity variable for
each day.
